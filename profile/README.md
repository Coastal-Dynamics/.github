## Hello coastal enthusiasts! 👋


Welcome to the Coastal Dynamics organisation. This organisation supports a set of Coastal Dynamics Open Education tools, consisting of: 

1. [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202)
2. Coastal Codebook: supplementary jupyter notebooks providing interactive exercises with the textbook
3. Coastal Quizbook: quizzes for each chapter of the textbook

For now, the following public repositories are available: 
1. Coastal Codebook: a set of notebooks including required modules and question files (publicly available soon!)
2. coastal-dynamics: a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/coastal-dynamics/), which is designed for creating interactive questions, complete with a simple grading mechanism.
