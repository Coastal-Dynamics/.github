## Hello coastal enthusiasts! 🌊

Welcome to the Coastal Dynamics organisation. This organisation supports a set of Coastal Dynamics Open Education tools developed at Delft University of Technology. The set consists of: 

1. [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202)
2. Coastal Codebook: supplementary jupyter notebooks providing interactive exercises with the Textbook
3. Coastal Quizbook: quizzes for each Chapter of the Textbook. **Soon these quizzes can be taken online, more information will follow**.

The following public repositories are available: 
1. [Coastal Codebook](https://github.com/Coastal-Dynamics/CoastalCodebook): the full set of notebooks including required modules, images, question files and (a link to) a database
2. [coastal-dynamics](https://github.com/Coastal-Dynamics/coastal-dynamics): a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/coastal-dynamics/) designed for creating the interactive questions in the Coastal Codebook, complete with a simple grading mechanism.
3. Coastal Quizbook: a web-based Python application for quizzes including conversion scripts from Möbius to the Quizbook (**publicly available soon!**).
